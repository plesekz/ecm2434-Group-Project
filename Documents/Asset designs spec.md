# Character asset designs

Low pixel count, segmented into pieces to allow for animation, on transparent background. Each piece must be made with interchangability in mind (eg each torso must have the same dimensions and be designed such that the shoulders of each torso are in the same place) to allow for generic animations.
Each faction should have their own colour theme, red for NetSamuri and green for Farmer's Consume.
Each piece should be in a transparent image file.
Each class should have their own design.

# Boss asset designs

Designed in a similar way as character assets.
Further spec will depend on the bosses.

# Item asset designs

Low pixel count, similar to character assets.
Should be designed with any character in mind, so any item of each type can be placed in the same way.
