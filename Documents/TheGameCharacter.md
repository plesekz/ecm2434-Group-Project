# Character customisation logic

# Improvement options
The character menu is really just a shop where the user spends their resources to better their character. It will have buttons that "spend" the resources and in exchange improve the character's statistics.

# Character improvement database
This will hold all the characters stats and details for upgrading. It will be updated with the stats from the shop.
