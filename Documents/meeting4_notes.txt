	System requirements

	Software license

	Add to github:
		nickdfross

	add testing
		they are readily available in Django

	elaborate in the ReadMe.txt

	add comments everywhere

	codebase seems okay
	good thing we have dtb


product side:
	slaes pitch
		lead the whole thing as a story

process feedback:
	good kanbaan structure
	good to see policies and procedures and meeting notes
	everyone is accountable and people are tagged
	pleased to see the description field being used in each card
	to improve
		add more detail to the kanbaan board
			the tasks describe only high level items
			there is no prioritisation
		policy details need to be expanded
			there is no insight what the product will look like
			there is no 

			specification adds no detail what constitutes the product being complete
			would be good to see workload estimation
				(for the future, and what was done too.)
			no policies what should be done in the specification and validation step
				have a policy what a specification looks like
				have a policy what needs to be checked in the validation step
			
random note:
	if going with the champion combat
		have linear distance rather than map
