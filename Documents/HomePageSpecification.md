# Home/Landing page specificaion
the home page will be the default place when you get to the website, this means its path will be `/`
this page will serve as a hub to all the other pages, this means it will essentially be an index for all the other pages.

## if the user is not logged in
if the user is not logged in then they should be redirected to the login page at `/login`
it will be determined if the user is logged in via the cookie that they should have.

## navigation
if the user is logged in the home page should have options for them to be able to get to the following pages:
1. The page for scanning qr codes
2. A page where the user can view/spend their current resources and their factions resources
3. Somewhere the user can see what resources are availiable and where to find them

## design
the page should be designed in a way that the user can easily navigate to each of the availiable pages clearly
